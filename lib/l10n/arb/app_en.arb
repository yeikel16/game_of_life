  "gameDescription": " is a cellular automaton designed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway, in 1970. It is a game with zero players, with an initial state that determines its evolution, without requiring additional intervention.\nThe \"game board\" is made up of squares called \"cells\", which form a mesh similar to a chessboard. Each cell has 8 \"neighboring\" cells, which are the ones that are next to it, including the diagonals. The cells have two states: \"alive\" or \"dead\". Each turn determines the state of the cells and allows you to predict their state for the next one. They are updated simultaneously based on three simple rules: ",
